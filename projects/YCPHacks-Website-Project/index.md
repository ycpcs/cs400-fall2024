## YCPHacks Project Description
Here is the [initial description for the YCPHacks Website Project](YCPHacks-Capstone-Project-Description.pdf)

You will be continuing development of this project, building upon the accomplishments of last year's CS Capstone I (CS400) and Capstone II (CS402) teams.  You will acquire the information for your project proposal, Use Cases and User Stories, and Requirements from your clients, as well as from the prior team's progress (Final Technical Reports from CS400 and CS402).  Your clients will also establish your tasks and priorities in consultation with us, and with your input, as you plan and develop the sprint schedule for your agile development approach.

1) Production Website: Finalizing the YCPHacks Website for use for this Fall's YCPHacks Hackathon.  Developing robustness, security, and performing load testing, and exercising it through a "mock" hackathon prior to the YCPHacks hackathon.

2) Extending Functionality: Identifying, designing, prototyping, developing additional functionality for the YCPHacks website for future years.

NOTE: It will be likely that members of the development team will be pulled into testing and possibly fixing the production website as we get closer to YCPHacks.  After YCPHacks (CS402) all team members will be working on bug fixes and new functionality, as well as increasing the robustness of the website.

We highly recommend that you continue working on this project in CS402 in the Spring, as it will provide you with a valuable year-long, comprehensive, client-based, team project experience, and CS402 counts as a CS elective toward your CS major requirements.
