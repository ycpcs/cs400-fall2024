# Tasks

There are three tasks which are part of this assignment.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



## Proposal

Your first task is to develop an initial proposal for your team's project. Your team must demonstrate that there will be design and implementation of a substantial software system.

Your team should then write a 2-4 page report describing your chosen/assigned task(s) both for the project and individual team members.  In order to properly define your team's work, you will need to arrange meetings and hold conversations with your clients, as well as familiarize yourself with the current state of the project through previous team members if it is a continuation from a prior year.

Your team project proposal report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your team?
-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project (see the GitHub task below)?
-   What is the current state of the system that you will be working on?
-   What problem is solved by the system your team will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system, and WHY are you choosing them (what are their advantages over other possible choices)?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use drawings, block diagrams, wire frames, screen captures, as appropriate, to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Your Instructor[s]!

You are **strongly** encouraged to meet with your instructor[s] to discuss project ideas before you submit your formal project proposal.

## Set up a GitHub repository with appropriate folder structure.

Your second task is to create a main repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add the instructors to the repository.

In the issue tracker for the main repository, create three labels:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per group member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your team may add additional labels as desired.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each team member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software they will need for the project.  **If this is a continuation of a prior project, you should have the current application code base up and runnning on each of your development PCs.**

You may use the physical space and computing equipment in KEC118 as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other teams, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.

Please note that you are **NOT** required to use one of the provided lab PCs: you can use your own laptop, if you would prefer. There will be weekly status meetings and milestone presentations in KEC 119, so you'll need to be able to transport your work to that room for demonstration purposes.
